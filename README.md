## Usage
To be able to use the pipeline, you need an authentication token(details on API web page).
The tool reads the token from `pipeline.token` file(under the same directory with the tool) by default.

`pipeline.caller.py filename`
reads input file <filename>, prints the output under `./pipeline_caller_output/output<%system_time>`

You can select the pipeline tool by using -t option
`pipeline.caller.py filename -t <tool name>`
default is "pipelineNoisy"

You can force the encoding for I/O by using -e option
`pipeline.caller.py filename -e <encoding>`
default is your system locale

And you can change the output directory by using -o option
`pipeline.caller.py filename -o another_directory`
default is "pipeline_caller_output"

##  Defaults

Check DEFAULTS block in the source code if you need to change one of these:

`api_url = "http://tools.nlp.itu.edu.tr/SimpleApi"` 

`pipeline_encoding = 'UTF-8'`

`token_path = "pipeline.token"`
